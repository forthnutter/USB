GENERAL
-------

parashell is a Parallel Port interface for Linux and Windows.

Under Linux parashell allows the control of multiple Parallel Ports through simple command
line arguments.

Under Windows parashell allows reading and writing of the CONTROL, DATA, and STATUS bytes on the default parallel port (usually 0x378)

pin is also included for Linux, which reads the status of a parallel port.
(ie., you can use the parallel port as an input device)

All you need is some scripting knowledge, a parallel port and some misc electronic components.
